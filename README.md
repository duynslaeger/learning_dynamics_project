# Climate policies under wealth inequality

## Overview
This project contains Python scripts for generating specific plots. There are two main scripts that can be run to generate the desired graphs:

1. `plot_gradient.py`: This script is used to generate gradient plots.
2. `plot_group_achievement.py`: This script is used to generate group achievement plots.

All other Python files in this project are either classes or hand-made libraries that support the functionalities of the main scripts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The required libraries and dependencies will be listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Running the Scripts
To generate the desired plots, run the appropriate script in your terminal:

For gradient plots:
```bash
python plot_gradient.py
```

For group achievement plots:
```bash
python plot_group_achievement.py
```

## Additional Information
The additional Python files in this project are designed to modularize the code and provide reusable components. These files do not need to be run independently.
